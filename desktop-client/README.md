# yamot - Yet Another MOnitoring Tool

## Desktop Client

This is an alternative electron-based client for your desktop. 

It does not require an additional client or controller, but comes with a built-in server to monitor your local machine.

Currently there is only a build for linux available.

### Building (Optional)

Change into __desktop-client__ directory. Then run `npm install` and `npm start`. 

The transpiled files will be written into __build__ folder.

### Startup

Just run the __yamot__ file (in __build__ directory) via `bash`. 

On first startup a setup (for built-in server) will appear.
